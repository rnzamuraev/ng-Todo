# My pet project on Angular - Todo List

Project using the following libraries and technologies:

1. [Angular](https://angular.io/)
2. [RxJs](https://rxjs.dev/index)
3. [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/)
4. [Layout](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/material-dashboard)
   The layout was taken in order to save time on writing styles, but it turned out probably the other way around, since the folder with all the Bootstrap styles was downloaded and inserted into the project. A lot of time was spent removing unnecessary styles
